##1. Second Largest
Difficulty: Easy Accuracy: 26.72% Submissions: 1.4M Points: 2 Average Time: 15m
Given an array of positive integers arr[], return the second largest element from the array. If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

Note: The second largest element should not be equal to the largest element.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.
Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.
Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element does not exist.
Constraints:
2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105



## Answer :Python:
class Solution:
    def getSecondLargest(self, arr):
        firstL = secondL = -1
      
        for num in arr:
            if num > firstL:
                secondL = firstL 
                firstL = num 
            elif num < firstL and num > secondL:
                secondL = num ##found 
        return secondL 







## 2. Move all zeros to end 
You are given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. You have to move all the zeros in the array to the right end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The operation must be performed in place, meaning you should not use extra space for another array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.
Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105


## answer :python:
class Solution:
	def pushZerosToEnd(self, arr):
	    for i in arr[:] :
            if i == 0:
                arr.remove(i)
                arr.append(0)
        return arr
